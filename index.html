    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve always been driven by the idea of <strong>making life more exciting</strong> by reducing repetitive tasks and replacing them with <strong>intuitive, intelligent tools</strong>. <br/>
        That passion led me to <strong>programming</strong>—a way to turn ideas into <strong>real-world solutions</strong>. <br/>
        I’ve completed a <strong>Python basics course</strong> and am now advancing my skills through the <strong>"Become a Full-Stack Web Developer with just ONE course"</strong> program, <br/>
        mastering <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern web technologies, including React and Node.js</strong>. <br/>
        Ambitious, persistent, and highly collaborative, I aim to build technologies that don’t just function but <strong>genuinely enhance everyday life</strong>.
